class VisibleOnFocus extends StatefulWidget {
  /// A widget that ensures the focused child remains visible and scrolled into view
  /// when the keyboard appears.
  ///
  /// The [VisibleOnFocus] widget listens to changes in the platform's window
  /// insets, particularly when the keyboard appears on screen. When a widget,
  /// such as a [TextField], inside [VisibleOnFocus] gains focus, it automatically
  /// scrolls to make sure the widget is visible and centered in the scrollable
  /// parent.
  ///
  /// This is useful for forms or text fields in a scrollable layout, where the
  /// keyboard might obstruct part of the screen.
  ///
  /// The widget should be used in scrollable contexts, such as with [ListView]
  /// or [SingleChildScrollView].
  ///
  /// ### Example usage:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// VisibleOnFocus(
  ///   child: TextField(
  ///     decoration: InputDecoration(
  ///       labelText: 'Enter your text',
  ///     ),
  ///   ),
  /// )
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ### Parameters:
  /// - `child`: The widget (e.g., [TextField] or [TextFormField]) that should
  ///   become visible when it receives focus.
  /// - `alignment`: Scrolls the scrollables that enclose the given context so as to make the given context visible.
  ///    If the [Scrollable] of the provided [BuildContext] is a [TwoDimensionalScrollable], 
  ///    both vertical and horizontal axes will ensure the target is made visible..
  /// - `animationDuration`: Animation duration defaults to 200 milliseconds.
  /// - `curve`: Animation curve (e.g., [Curves.linear], [Curves.fastLinearToSlowEaseIn]) defaults to [Curves.easeInOut]
  ///
  /// ### How it works:
  /// - When the child widget gains focus (e.g., a text field being tapped), the
  ///   keyboard may obscure part of the screen. [VisibleOnFocus] listens to
  ///   platform metrics and ensures the focused widget is scrolled into view,
  ///   keeping it visible and centered within the scrollable area.
  ///
  /// ### Limitations:
  /// - Make sure the [VisibleOnFocus] widget is wrapped within a scrollable
  ///   parent (like [ListView] or [SingleChildScrollView]) for it to function
  ///   correctly.
